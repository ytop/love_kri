- updateatomickri function - This method currently tries to
  call a missing updateatomickri database RPC function. The
  function needs to be created in the database (requires
  database migration permissions). For now, it's marked with a
  TODO comment for future implementation.

evidence tabs 和 audit trail tabs 宽度随地大小变
  - Problem: Tab container width changes when switching between Evidence and Audit Trail tabs
  - Root cause: Element UI tabs only render active tab content, causing width calculation based on current tab only
  - Attempted solutions:
    * fit-content with min/max-width constraints - failed (only considers active tab)
    * Off-screen rendering of inactive tabs - failed (Element UI still hides inactive content)
    * Fixed min-width with responsive max-width - partial solution but not dynamic
  - Current status: not fixed
  - Ideal solution needed: Dynamic width calculation based on max(evidence_content_width, audit_content_width)
Improve UI/UX desig

@Kridetail.vue
Sub-KRIs are treated as flat rows during sort rather than as children of a parent KRI.

So Currently the permission and the display dashboard did not take view permission into consideration(invest it), I need it to be online since we have hide all data from anom.

Use atomic1.evidence.view / atomic1.evidence.download / atomic1.evidence.delete to check if the user has permission to view/download/delete the evidence.
