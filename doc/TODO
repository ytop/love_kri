evidence tabs 和 audit trail tabs 宽度随意大小变化
  - Problem: Tab container width changes when switching between Evidence and Audit Trail tabs
  - Root cause: Element UI tabs only render active tab content, causing width calculation based on current tab only
  - Attempted solutions:
    * fit-content with min/max-width constraints - failed (only considers active tab)
    * Off-screen rendering of inactive tabs - failed (Element UI still hides inactive content)
    * Fixed min-width with responsive max-width - partial solution but not dynamic
  - Current status: not fixed
  - Ideal solution needed: Dynamic width calculation based on max(evidence_content_width, audit_content_width)
